Goal
----
Publication title will be something similar to "Platform for design and test of Interfering Satellite Viruses" 

As demonstrated in prior work (*), it is possible to create defective interfering virus particles against a few infectious mammalian viruses. The goal of this work would be to create a "recipe" for this process and an automatable protocol for rigorously testing the interfering virus efficiency. The design process will involve removal of key components of the wild-type virus genome, such as capsid genes.
