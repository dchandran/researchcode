Synthetic biology is the programming of living systems by modifying the genetic code. In order to communicate the function performed by the DNA code, the engineer must provide numerous details, such as analysis of experimental results or mathematical analyses. The software tool we are developing aims to improve exchange and reuse of synthetic biology designs. This is achieved by providing a user interface to sketch DNA as a composition of reusable components; each component can be associated to specific details of an experiment or analysis pipeline.
