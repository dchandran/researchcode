Goal 1: Understanding the software tools available
Timeline: 1 week

Tasks:
1. Reading publications on the following software tools: VIROME, MetaVir, QIIME, RAST
2. Skimming publications that have used the above software tools
3. Get a few raw data sets, which are available at MetaVir website, VIROME website, and iMicrobe.
4. Use the software tools on public virome data sets
 

Goal 2: Understanding protocols for Virome sequencing
Timeline: 1 week

Tasks:
1. Identify sequencing services available via Assay Depot or Science Exchange and get quotes
2. Identify DNA extraction services available via Assay Depot or Science Exchange and get quotes


Goal 3: Extract viruses
Timeline: 3-4 days

Tasks:
1. Collect 100-400mL water sample from the bay
2. Order virus extraction kit and positive control viruses/DNA
3. Order primers for checking whether the positive control virses were extracted
4. Perform the protocol by following the instructions provided in the kit
5. PCR (or rtPCR via Transcriptic) to check whether the positive control viruses were extracted properly 
6. If positive control is ok, then ship the sample to DNA extraction facility



Budget (rough):
TOTAL ~ $4000
  Virus extraction kit ~ $400
  Transcriptic rtPCR ~ $100
  DNA Sequencing (Illumina)~ $3000
  DNA extraction service ~ $100
