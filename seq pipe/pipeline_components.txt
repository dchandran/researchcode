PIPELINE COMPONENTS
===================

0) Quality Control - ??
1) BLAST + phylogenetic analyses
   important factors: 
       a) choice of DBs: SEED, NR-NR, RefSeqVirus, JCBI, MGOL (CAMERA)
       b) BLAST small reads (translated), not contigs
   or use HMM instead of BLAST

2) Clustering + rarefaction 
3) GO and other annotations based on (1)
4) k-mer analyses + MSD/PCA - only seen in Metavir2, not common, but looks useful
