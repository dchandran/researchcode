PIPELINE COMPONENTS
===================

0) Quality Control - remove low scores, short sequences, Ns
1) Identify ORFs using MetaGene or others
2) BLAST + phylogenetic analyses
   important factors: 
       a) choice of DBs: SEED, NR-NR, RefSeqVirus, JCBI, MGOL (CAMERA)
       b) BLAST small reads (translated), not contigs
   or use HMM instead of BLAST

3) Clustering + rarefaction 
4) GO and other annotations based on (1)
5) k-mer analyses + MSD/PCA - seen in Metavir2 and MetaBAT


Other Methods
=============
1) GeoChip and HumiChip for high throughput expression profiling
2) "individual cell genomes are hybridized against a set of individual viral genomes from the same sample, previously immobilized on a microarray" http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140814/ncomms5542/full/ncomms5542.html



TOOLS & DBs
===========
MGOL: Metagenomics data, esp enviromnetal sampling such as Global Ocean Expedition
http://metagenomesonline.org/library.php

ViroBLAST: blast against multiple DBs

CloVR: sequence analysis on the cloud

Pandaseq: create contigs from Illumina reads. Also includes PHRED read quality scores

MetaBAT: bins (classify?) genomes
