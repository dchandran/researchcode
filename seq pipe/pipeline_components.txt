PIPELINE COMPONENTS
===================

0) Quality Control - ??
1) BLAST + phylogenetic analyses
   important factors: 
       a) choice of DBs: SEED, NR-NR, RefSeqVirus, JCBI, MGOL (CAMERA)
       b) BLAST small reads (translated), not contigs
   or use HMM instead of BLAST

2) Clustering + rarefaction 
3) GO and other annotations based on (1)
4) k-mer analyses + MSD/PCA - only seen in Metavir2, not common, but looks useful


Other Methods
=============
1) GeoChip and HumiChip for high throughput expression profiling
2) "individual cell genomes are hybridized against a set of individual viral genomes from the same sample, previously immobilized on a microarray" http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2014/140814/ncomms5542/full/ncomms5542.html
