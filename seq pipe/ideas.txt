Drones for sampling
-------------------
1) Use on-board devices for DNA sequencing, imaging, spectrophotometry
Issue: (a) cannot achieve metagenomics-level sequencing , (b) imaging will probably be mostly non-living things, and (c) spec might be too noisy

2) Smart sampling using swarm intelligence
Issues: requires fast measurements on the drones

Function sampling
-----------------
1) Use of BioLog
